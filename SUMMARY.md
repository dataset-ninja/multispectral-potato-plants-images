There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (1500 images) and *test* (300 images). Additionally, all images are grouped by their ***image_id***. Explore them in supervisely advanced labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Idaho, USA</span>.
